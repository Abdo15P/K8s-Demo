# K8s-Demo

This is a practice project to start working with Kubernetes. I worked on this project to get some hands-on practical exercise with Kubernetes.

## Approach

- Create the node.js app.

- Create the Dockerfile for the app.

- Build the image.

- Push the image to DockerHub.

- Create deployment and service yaml files.

- Apply the yaml files.

- Create replicas

- Get the IP of the service and test the app on a browser.
